* This is my Nutribullet blender that my mother got me one year ago for Christmas. She knew I desired a blender so that I can make protein smoothies and acai bowls, which I usually have some sort of smoothie everyday. In the pictures it is sitting on a blanket, which is rather abnormal to keep a blender on, but since we are close to the end of the semester I currently have a blanket covering my extra mini fridge that I snuck into the dorms. This is because I did not want to get written up when they do the health and safety checks for each dorm room before the break. 
* When I first got the blender I had no idea how to use it, and like every other normal person I decided not to read the user manual that was provided when I received it. My main goal with this newly acquired blender was to be able to make a protein smoothie. After plugging it in for the first time and throwing some fruit and protein powder into it, I am now about to use it. 
* Looking at the button options, my initial thought was to obviously press the button that looks like the well known or “universal” power button symbol in our region. After pressing that, the power button on the blender lit up blue(as shown in the image) insinuating that the blender now must be on. 
* After Knowing it was on, I then decided to start it off easy and click the button that says low. It blended pretty well and I could’ve just made a smoothie by keeping it on low, but since it was my first time using it I wanted to use all the buttons. I assumed that the button that said “Med,” meant medium and when I clicked that it increased the speed of the blender, and then clicking the button with High on it, increased the blender's speed to its maximum output. After I clearly saw that the fruits I put in the blender were fully blended, my goal was completed. The **efficiency** of using the blender allowed me to accomplish my goal within a minute or two, so I found it **useful** since it pleased my everyday smoothie cravings.
* I still continued to test out the other buttons just so I could know what they did. The button that says “Extract” turns the blender on and off in different timed synchronizations, and the button that says “Pulse” only causes the blender to blend when you have your finger held down on it. After testing every button, I can say that the blender has a well established **effectiveness** for the user with a variety of settings could lead me to a different way to achieve my goal of making a smoothie. I was very **satisfied** with the user experience of the device, and the blender had simple settings and was easily **memorable**.
