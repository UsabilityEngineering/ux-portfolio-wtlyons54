My mother got this speaker for me for christmas 6 or 7 years ago, as I wanted a big speaker back in highschool. Although I have had it for such a long time I have never really used every button/function that the speaker possesses. I haven't used every button because my main and only goal for having the speaker was to just be able to connect my phone to it and play music. First I had to click and hold down the power button to turn the speaker on. So when I wanted to connect my phone, my initial interaction when trying to connect using bluetooth was to hold down the bluetooth button, which didn’t work until I let go of it so I thought I had to do that everytime. The device was very **learnable** because after using the device a couple times I realized that all you had to do was click the bluetooth button once and it would already be in pairing mode, which made it also **memorable** since I became so accustomed to it. After connecting, a little bluetooth sign lights up on the screen, which is awesome as its great feedback to give the user to let them know that they are connected. Once I was connected I was able to play music and use the master volume knob on the right to turn up and down my music. It was very **efficient** to accomplish my goal of playing my own music, by just using the power button, bluetooth button, and the volume knob. Some of the features I did not use were the radio, the preference set buttons, microphone knob, and I typically don’t use the light button.
